# piTemp
Basic Temp sensor program to read a MCP9808 breakout sensor from Adafruit on a Raspberry Pi.

I hope to turn this into a more substantial project with some other sensors for a Pi I have in a network cabinet. That Pi is currently running Pi-hole on my network. I was kind of inspired by Padd.sh, which gives you a nice read out and stats from pi-hole in the terminal. One of the things it displays is the temperature of the Pi CPU (I think it's the CPU, whatever the Pi gives a temp) I thought it would be nice to get some other readings like ambient temperature, humidity, air quality, etc. and display them in a way similar to Padd or maybe an expanded Padd instance.

So far... just a janky python program asking for temp and displaying it in terminal and a file. Kind of boring.
